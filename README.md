# HELLO FRIENDS.

This project is no longer being maintained for the following reasons:
- I've left programming, and I was the only person maintaining it
- The sorting options need an overhaul to be more relevant to the way JS templates are currently used (e.g., parsing speed matters very little in a real-world app where templates should be compiled on the server)
- Many of the most currently popular template engines come bundled with a larger framework and cannot be examined on their own
- A standard of popularity, longevity, or both needs to be applied to sort viable options from things someone built for themself and made open source as an afterthought

Any and all of this code and/or research is yours to fork and use as you wish with absolutely no warranty of any kind. <3
